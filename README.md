# What the fck is this ?

It is a profile with pictures in HTML.

You can also search for the person you have saved - always search for the name you entered

It has an admin console where you can either delete specific things from a person or delete all information you have ever saved

The default username for the Admin login is: `Admin` and pass is: `Admin123` but this can be changed as required
